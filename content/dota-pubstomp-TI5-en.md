This year, Valve is organising DOTA 2's biggest tournament: **The International**.  

From the 3rd to the 8th August, the best DOTA 2 teams from all over the world fight in the Keyarena in Seattle for glory and the gigantic prize pool of about 15 million dollar.  

### Event coordination 

We, the **Hochschulgruppe eSports United Karlsruhe** (campus group), are showing the last three match days to celebrate the biggest spectacle of Dota2 this year together with fans in the region. DOTA 1 veterans as well as fresh DOTA 2 followers are welcome. We especially welcome those of you that want to get to know the phenomenon DOTA.  

If you are interested in helping with organising this event, feel free to contact us through Facebook or reddit (see below for details).

### Venue

The pubstomp is happening at [AKK](http://www.akk.org/adresse.php) on campus of KIT.
Drinks are available at prices for students (*1,50â‚¬ a beer* to give you an idea about prices). We are working on providing some food and will report with news.

For saturday, it is planned to use the outside tribune, if the weather allows it. Visitors are advised **to bring their own blanket or similar** for their own comfort.

**Stream:** We will use the broadcast featuring the English casters.
